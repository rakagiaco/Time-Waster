## The Great Sundering - The Catastrophe That Started Everything

### What Happened
Long ago, three realms existed in harmony:
- **The Crystalline Empire** (North) - Masters of dimensional magic and reality manipulation
- **The Sand Kingdoms** (East) - Guardians of time and temporal stability  
- **The Elden Forest** (West) - Protectors of life and natural balance

These realms were connected by **Reality Anchors** - massive crystalline structures that maintained the dimensional barriers between worlds. The anchors were:
- **The Crystalline Anchor** (hidden in the Convergence Valley)
- **The Sand Anchor** (protected by the Sand Kingdoms)
- **The Forest Anchor** (guarded by the Elden Forest)

### The Catastrophe
The Great Sundering occurred when the **Void** - a malevolent force from beyond reality - corrupted the Reality Anchors. This caused:
- Dimensional barriers to collapse
- Time and space to become unstable
- The three realms to merge chaotically in the Convergence Valley
- Reality storms that constantly shift the landscape
- The emergence of **Nepian** - Void-corrupted creatures

### The Current State
The Convergence Valley is now a chaotic realm where:
- Dimensional energy runs wild
- Time flows inconsistently
- Space constantly shifts and warps
- Nepian creatures spread corruption
- The original inhabitants are either dead, corrupted, or hiding

## The Quest Line - Story Context and Item Necessity

### **Quest 1: Echoes of the Convergence**

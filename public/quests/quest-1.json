    "description" : "Greetings, traveler. I am Narvark, a scholar of the dimensional arts. You've entered the Convergence Valley - a place where three realms once met in harmony. Now it's a reality storm where time and space constantly shift. Strange herbs grow here, pulsing with dimensional energy. They may hold the key to understanding what happened to this place. Will you help me collect five of these dimensional herbs?",
    "requirements" : "Narvark wants you to collect 5 dimensional herbs scattered throughout the valley",
    "completiontext" : "Excellent! These herbs contain traces of pure dimensional energy. They're not corrupted like everything else here. This gives me hope that we can still save this place.",

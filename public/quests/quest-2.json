    "description" : "My analysis of the herbs reveals something disturbing. They contain traces of Void energy - the same force that's corrupting this valley. The herbs speak of creatures called Nepian that emerged when the dimensional barriers collapsed. They're feeding on the valley's reality, turning it into their domain. I need you to eliminate five Nepian scouts in the southern regions. They're the weakest of their kind, but they're spreading the corruption.",

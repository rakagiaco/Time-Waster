    "description" : "The Electro Lord's heart has revealed the truth. This valley was once the Convergence Point where three realms met. The old mine contains a gateway to the Crystalline Empire's ruins. The Nepian are using it to bring more of their kind into our world. I need you to clear the mine of Nepian forces and secure the gateway. This will cut off their reinforcements and give us access to the Empire's ancient knowledge.",

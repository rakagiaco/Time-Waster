    "description" : "I've discovered something crucial. The Nepian aren't just random invaders - they're being led by something called an Electro Lord. This creature is a Void entity that's been corrupting the valley's dimensional anchors. If we can destroy it and claim its heart, we might be able to begin restoring the dimensional barriers. The Electro Lord resides in the southeastern corner of the valley. This will be dangerous, but it's our only hope.",

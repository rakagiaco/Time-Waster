    "description" : "Excellent work, traveler. Thanks to your bravery, I can continue my experimentation. Traveler, the herbs you have collected me, along with the blood of the fallen Nepian should be enough to begin to create an elixir strong enough to quell whatever curse or binding has entrapped this valley. Traveler, there is one more task I must ask of you. As you know, the Nepian have completely overtaken the valley. They crawl through every corner of it, spewing their vile aura onto anything that comes within their reach. This must come to an end, one way or the other. A Nepian Electro Lord is said to reside in the southeastern corner of the valley. Traveler, I want you to defeat this foul creature, and bring me its heart.",

I have spent countless years researching the valley's curse. Never, until now, have I made any significant discoveries. Thanks to you, traveler, I now feel hopeful for the first time since I can remember. Traveler, we must continue to push the Nepian back. There are more Nepian just southeast of here. Please, slay them and collect some of their blood. Be warned traveler, these Nepian are stronger than the last ones you faced.",
